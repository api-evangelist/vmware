# VMWareThis is a repo for managing machine readable artifacts for the [VMWare APIs](https://www.vmware.com). The goal is to maintain and evolve an OpenAPI, Postman Collection, and APIs.json index for the [VMWare APIs](https://www.vmware.com).They are a constant work in progress, and will be updated on a regular basis when new information is added, or more of the specifications are supported.Feel free to submit a pull request to evolve any of the artifacts, and leave GitHub issues if you have any questions, comments, or feedback.- [Website](https://www.vmware.com)- [Developer](https://www.vmware.com)- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/VMware)- [GitHub](https://github.com/VMware)The [APIs.json](https://github.com/api-evangelist/vmware/blob/master/apis.json) index provides links to all the relevant links for the VMWare APIs, including the OpenAPI and Postman if they are present.
